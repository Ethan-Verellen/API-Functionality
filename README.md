## Description

A way to experiment with basic API's and using backend programs like insomnia


## Useage

In order to use this project, I suggest you find it in a terminal/git and run the line npm i. Then you should go to the /db folder and go into postgres, and run \i schema.sql. Then go to the main page in the terminal and type /npm run seed.  Then type npm run start.  then open up a program like insomnia and go to the http://localhost:3001/api/(route) to be able to work with it.
